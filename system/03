Hostname - is a name of computer, which usually specified during the installation of the operating system. It is possible to change the hostname. And u have two option here - to change it temporarily or to change it permanently. In first case u can just run [>sudo hostname newname]. New computer name will be installed immediately after execution and will be active until the next reboot of the system. But if want to rename your computer permanently, u should know more. Systems based on Debian read the /etc /hostname file to set the computer name. After that, the read name is set when the init script is running /etc/init.d/hostname (or /etc/init.d/hostname.sh). Thus, in order to learn the current name of the machine, in addition to the above method, you can also use the following approach:
> cat /etc/hostname 
> sudo vim /etc/hostname
